The variables that are declared within the block scope are comparable to local ones. They are available within the block that they are defined.

                <h1>How does the Event Loop works in JavaScript?</h1>
                <p> <span><b>Answer: </b></span>The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks the Task Queue for available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes it to the Call Stack, waits for the Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the same process.</p>
                <p>A queue is a data structure that works on the First in First out principle, so as tasks get pushed into the queue, they get out in that same order. Tasks that have been executed by the Web API’s, which are being pushed to the Task Queue, then go back to the Call Stack to get their result printed out.</p>

                <h1>How many way to get undefined in javascript.</h1>
                <p> <span><b>Answer: </b></span>There are 8 ways to get undefined in javascript. Which are as follows:</p>
                <p><span><b>01. </b></span>Variable that is not initialized will give undefined.</p>
                <p><span><b>02. </b></span>Function with no return.</p>
                <p><span><b>03. </b></span>Parameter that is not passed will be undefined.</p>
                <p><span><b>04. </b></span>If return has nothing on the right side will return undefined.</p>
                <p><span><b>05. </b></span>Property that doesn't exists on an object will give you undefined.</p>
                <p><span><b>06. </b></span>Accessing array elements outside of the index range.</p>
                <p><span><b>07. </b></span>Deleting an element inside an array.</p>
                <p><span><b>08. </b></span>Set a value directly to undefined.</p>
